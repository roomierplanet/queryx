World War II (WW2) was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved most of the countries in the world, divided into two opposing alliances: the Allies and the Axis.

The main causes of WW2 were the rise of fascism and totalitarianism in Germany, Italy and Japan, the aggression and expansion of these countries in Europe and Asia, and the failure of the League of Nations to prevent war.

Some of the major events of WW2 were:

- The invasion of Poland by Germany in 1939, which triggered the war in Europe
- The Battle of Britain in 1940, which prevented Germany from invading Britain by air
- The attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan in 1941, which brought the United States into the war
- The Battle of Stalingrad in 1942-1943, which turned the tide of the war in favor of the Soviet Union against Germany
- The D-Day landings in Normandy in 1944, which opened a second front in Western Europe
- The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States in 1945, which forced Japan to surrender

WW2 ended with the defeat of the Axis powers and the emergence of the United States and the Soviet Union as superpowers. It also resulted in millions of deaths, widespread destruction, human rights violations, and the formation of the United Nations.
